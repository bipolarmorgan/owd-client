## Overview
Open Web Desktop (previously *hacklover-client*, aka what you can see [on my website](https://hacklover.net))
is a project that aims to provide a simple environment to create your own web desktop.
Based on Vue.js, it has been rewritten to be fully modular.

[Check the demo](https://demo.owdproject.com) of this `owd-client` base repository. 

## Features
- Open-source web desktop client based on Vue.js
- Fully extendable through client and server modules
- Fully extendable through pages and components
- Global terminal commands support
- Global notifications through SSE
- Vuetify.js implemented by default

## Getting started
In the future there will be a tool to bootstrap your OWD client.  
For now, you have to follow some easy steps as explained below.

- Make sure you have Git and Node.js installed
- Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/owd-project/owd-client`
- Copy the folder `packages/owd-client` in a new location of your choice
- Enter that directory with `cd <your-path>/owd-client`
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run your OWD client with `npm run serve`

## Modules
Each OWD module may include a `client` or a `server` folder.
There is no CLI available for modules installation at the moment, so you should install each module manually.
Here you can find [some modules](https://github.com/topics/owd-modules) available for everyone.

### Install a new module
You can install modules by copying the content of the `client` module folder into
`src/modules/<module-name>`.

#### Install module dependencies
Some modules may have additional [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) dependencies that you have to install manually.
To do so, check the "dependencies" property in the `src/modules/<module-name>/module.json` configuration.  

Then run `npm install <dependency-name>` for each dependency to install them like every npm module.

#### Define the installed module
To be able to load the installed modules into your OWD client, you have to define them under `config/modules.json`.
Edit that file and be sure to add every module in `modulesEnabled` like in the example:

```json
{
  "type": "client",
  "modulesEnabled": {
    "sample": {
      "name": "sample",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "url": "https://www.github.com/hacklover/owd-sample"
    },
    "your-module-name": {
      "name": "your-module-name",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "url": ""
    }
  }
}
```
